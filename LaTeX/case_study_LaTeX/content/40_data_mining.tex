%External Knowledge
%– Are additional datasets used?

% ML approaches
% – How many different ML approaches were tried out?
% – Do you have at least one symbolic and one non symbolic approach? (yes non-symbolic: decision tree; symbolic: NN)
% – Do you have at least one baseline (majority class / mean value / domain specific ...)? (yes: KNN is baseline)

% • Evaluation
% – Is there a train test split or 10-fold cross validation implemented
% – Is eval stratified?
% – Cost matrix or not?
% – Are the hyper parameters tuned (in which range / which attributes) ?
% – Are the tests systematic?
% – Analyse a symbolic model (how does the decision tre
