\section{What is the problem you are solving?}

\section{What data will you use?}

\section{How will you solve the problem?}\unsure{M端ssen wir das k端rzen?}
\subsection{What preprocessing steps will be required?}
To prepare the data we received in the dataset to be useful for our different algorithms a couple of preprocessing
steps will be required. This includes the following:

\textbf{Under-/oversampling -- data balancing} In a first glance at the data we have noticed that the class distribution is
unbalanced (there are more normal wines than great or bad ones). For that reason we have to decide what to do about it -- how many classes we want to predict (e.g. binary classification or three classes: bad, normal and good), and how we want to distribute the samples among the classes so that it is balanced (e.g. via under- or oversampling).

\textbf{Data analysis and inspection} The next step would be to have a look at the data whether there are duplicates, null values or outliers in the data. Additionally, we can analyse whether there is any correlation between different features in the dataset. Furthermore, we could have a look into if we want to indroduce additional features to improve the classifier.

\textbf{Feature standardization of numerical values (normilaztion)} In order to have good results when building the classifiers we have to bring each numerical features into the same scale so one feature doesn't have a bigger impact on the outcome than others. For that reason we have do standardize or normalize the numerical features.

\subsection{Which algorithms do you plan to use?}
We plan on using six to seven different classifiers to solve the problem. Since we 
are trying to solve a classification task, the algorithms we plan on using are classification
algorithms.

Firstly, we are planning on using \textbf{k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)} as a baseline\unsure{Passt das mit der Baseline?}
algorithm for our classification problem as k-NN is quite a simple algorithm.

Additionally, we want to use \textbf{decision trees} to try build a model to classify the
data. As an extension of decision trees we are also interested in using a \textbf{random forest}
to derive a classifier.

Furthermore, other classification algorithms that we want to use include a \textbf{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}
or \textbf{logistic regression} -- although logistic regression could only be used if we decide on
a binary classification problem (i.e. deciding between wines of good and bad quality).

Moreover, we want to build a \textbf{neural network} that can predict if a given wine is of good or bad quality.

Finally, we are interested in using \textbf{outlier detection / anomaly detection algorithms} to detect the few 
excellent or poor wines that are given in the dataset.

Generally we want to use \textbf{feature selection} test for each algorithm if there are any features which are not relevent 
for classifying between good and bad wines to exclude them from the model. In addition to that we want to use 
\textbf{hyperparameter tuning} for the different algorithms to optimize the models.

\section{How will you measure success?}

\section{What do you expect your results to look like?}
We generally expect that there is a correlation between the make up of different wines and their taste (quality). Without analyzig the particular data set we found different sources that link for example the ph-value of wine to wether it is sour or mild. Furthermore attributes like alcohol percentage or sugar effect the sweetness of wine. Even though taste and quality might be subjective, for example sweeter wine might be generally more liked by a broader audience then bitter wine. That's why we expect to being able to predict the quality of different wines. Nonetheless the precision of our model could be rather poor, just because of the fact that quality and taste are subjective. On the other hand the quality of wine must be influenced by its ingredients, because of that our results might be more precise then we initially expect.
